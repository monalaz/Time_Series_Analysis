# Monte Carlo Simulation Results (GARCH Model)

This document summarizes and explains the output of a Monte Carlo simulation performed on **Bitcoin (BTC)** using a **GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity)** model. The simulation covered a horizon of **365 days** with **50,000 simulated paths**.

---

## Simulation Parameters
- **Model:** GARCH (1,1)
- **Number of paths:** 50,000
- **Time horizon:** 365 days (1 year)

---

## Results Overview

### Value at Risk (VaR)
- **95% VaR:** 0.973  
- **99% VaR:** 1.781  

Interpretation: With 95% confidence, the worst expected log-return loss does not exceed ~0.97. In a 1-in-100 scenario, the loss could be as extreme as ~1.78. VaR provides a threshold for potential losses under adverse market conditions.

---

### Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR / Expected Shortfall)
- **95% CVaR:** 1.495  
- **99% CVaR:** 2.350  

Interpretation: While VaR shows the cutoff, **CVaR measures the average of losses beyond that cutoff**. At the 95% level, the average extreme loss is ~1.50, and at the 99% level it is ~2.35. This metric gives a more conservative and realistic view of tail risk.

---

### Expected Log Return
- **0.633**

Interpretation: On average, across all simulated paths, the model projects a positive log-return, indicating **overall growth potential** despite volatility and downside risks.

---

### Probability of Loss
- **25.16%**

Interpretation: There is about a **one-in-four chance** that the final portfolio value after 365 days ends below the starting value.

---

### Average Maximum Drawdown
- **-57.45%**

Interpretation: The typical path experiences a maximum peak-to-trough decline of **57%**. This highlights the **severity of intra-year volatility** in crypto markets.

---

### Ruin Probability (50% Threshold)
- **25.18%**

Interpretation: There is roughly a **25% probability** that the portfolio value falls to **below half its initial level** at some point during the year.

---

## Key Insights
- The GARCH model captures **time-varying volatility**, which is well-suited for highly volatile assets like Bitcoin.  
- Despite a positive average return, downside risk is significant: **high drawdowns and heavy-tail losses** occur in a substantial fraction of paths.  
- Risk management strategies (stop-losses, diversification, position sizing) are essential when trading or investing in such volatile assets.

---

## Conclusion
This simulation shows that while the **expected return is positive**, the **risks are severe**. Investors and traders must account for extreme drawdowns and significant probabilities of large losses when dealing with crypto assets. The results reinforce the dual nature of crypto markets: **high growth potential** but also **substantial downside risk**.
